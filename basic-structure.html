        of a dog because they can catch every criminal. Also, large communities
        conduct dog events worldwide. Thus, every year, people can see

    <h2>Cats</h2>
      <p>Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans.
        Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000
        years ago. Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human
        communities. The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the
        affectionate attention of humans. Early Egyptians worshipped a cat
        goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the
        next worldâ€”accompanied by mummified mice! Cultures around the world
        later adopted cats as their own companions. (copied from google)</p>
